sfml-box2d-demo
===============

A simple Box2D + SFML combination, where the user can use the mouse to create rectangular bodies. Great for virtual dominoes!

You can draw out rectangles with your mouse, which become physics objects. You can also press space to toggle showing the mouse cursor, in case you have a touch screen.

[Download the executable](https://github.com/dag10/sfml-box2d-demo/releases/tag/v1.0) to try it out!
